# Dev branch: Experimental mono repo (do not delete)

This git branch is an experimental use of bun's workspaces. Currently the bun (9th July 2024) bun is still experimental but is very ahead of beneficial compared to `node` to ignore it. Workspaces which is suposed to help setup mono repos without 3rd party. However it comes with too many caveats and we don't have the man power to do brute-force through it (maybe in the future). There's also incompatibility issues with existing monorepo solutions likes _turborepo_. So I've set this branch aside and will come back to it later.

For now, we'll stick to a simple repository and prioritize agility.
